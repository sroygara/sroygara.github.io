Hi friends, I hope you're well. My motivation for creating this page is to present some for-fun side readings I'm doing in a digestible format. I'm a big fan of the Feynman method, that is the best way to learn something is to  explain something in a simplified manner. Therefore, that is what I will set out to do here. I look forward to this journey of learning while sharpening my writing skills.

Here is some sample math for testing: 


$$\begin{align}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{align}$$
